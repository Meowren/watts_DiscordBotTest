# Watts: themousery's chatbot

Watts is a chatbot that is intelligent, creative, clever, and very friendly. He is a work-in-progress and will only get more intelligent as technology progresses.

Watts is currently live on themousery's Discord: https://www.themousery.com/discord. (He's hidden until my next video but if you want to talk to him, just give me a nod and I'll let you in).

You're welcome to use any of this code for whatever. NOTE: if you use this repo, make sure to add a `config.py` with the line `discord = "YOUR TOKEN HERE"`.
